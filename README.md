# DisabledComputerADFixAndReport

## Objective

Allows Disabled machines in Active Directory to be added to a report and re-enabled. In larger organizations after so much time without connection to the network, these machines become disabled and no longer allows machines to login.

The easiest fix for this is to re-enable the AD-Computer within Active Directory. While I have already written a script inside of PowerShell to do this, most technicians are not as familiar with the CLI as required to make modifications and use on a regular basis.

This application provides a graphical interface to run reports on disabled machines and re-enable them.

## Warning

This project is in ALPHA and does not have all features implemented at this time.
